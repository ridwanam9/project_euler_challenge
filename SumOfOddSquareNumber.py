# A number is a perfect square, or a square number, if it is the square of a positive integer.
# For example, 25 is a square number because 5^2 = 5 x 5 = 25; it is also an odd square.

# The first 5 square numbers are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and the sum of the odd squares is 1 + 9 + 25 = 35   .

# Among the first 881 thousand square numbers, what is the sum of all the odd squares?
